# TCXfilestodata
I wrote that code to collect several data from my endomondo account and plot them with calc.
This is the first time I use github, so I probably do everything wrong. Please, do not hesitate to "teach me how to fish"...

I use the code from vkurup https://github.com/vkurup/python-tcxparser/ (my appologies if i's not the way to give attribution to the authors).

I use the service taipiriik to link my endomondo account to my dropbox account (https://github.com/cpfair/tapiriik).

My goal was to be able to plot the distance I ride vs the time I ride over a year. When I use tapiriik, I obtain a file for each session I made (I run too) in one folder
I execute the python code in the folder where every .tcx files are and thanks to tcxparser I am able to obtain only one text file containing the date, distance and duration of each session "biking" session.
